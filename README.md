# Carpentry-Project

This project will contain a simple web service, which shall be served up via 
Apache Tomcat. The service will allow a customer to create an account with a 
carpentry business, choose from four different types of furniture, purchase
them, and see the status of their order. The carpentor shall be able to 
update an order, modify it if necessary, and mark the furniture as complete
and ready for pick up.
